# IndianConstitution

A Ruby gem providing structured access to the Indian Constitution's articles, amendments, and schedules. Designed for legal tech, news platforms, educational tools, and AI applications, this gem allows developers to easily retrieve and work with constitutional data. Inspired by the creator's UPSC background, this project aims to bridge legal knowledge and technology for broader accessibility.

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/indian_constitution`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Installation

The gem is not yet published to RubyGems.org as it’s in early development. To use the gem, install it directly from the GitHub repository by adding the following to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'indian_constitution', git: 'https://github.com/nizam12khan/indian-constitution-gem.git'
```
Then run 
```bundle install```

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

```bash
bundle add indian_constitution
```

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

```bash
gem install ./indian_constitution-0.1.0.gem
```

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
